# Markdown Format

## The content in the text file is actually in a format called Markdown. 

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing.
You can control the display of the document such as, 
- Formatting words as **bold** or *italic*
- Adding images
- Creating lists

are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

### Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like ``#`` or ``*``.

Markdown has become quite popular lately and you can find plenty of sites providing tutorial in the internet. You can try this [site](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to learn Markdown.

# Slides and Navigation
## But how do I make multiple slides in my slide show? Do I need to make one text file for each slide? That might be a lot of files!

A single Markdown file can contain all your slides.
We use a few simple and practical ways to break the content
into multiple slides.

- Use Top level headings to create a new slide.
- Use front matter to create a new slide.

## Navigating thru the slide show is simple
You can use PageUp, PageDown,
``↑`` [Up-Arrow],
``↓`` [Down-Arrow], ``→`` [Right-Arrow]	or  
``←`` [Left-Arrow] keys or simply mouse-wheel to navigate between the pages.

# Front Matter
In front of a slide or group of slides we can attach front matter. In the front
matter you can set values to some predefined properties to control aspects of slide generation.
